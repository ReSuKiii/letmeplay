To make a .exe file out of this :

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed letmeplay.py

.exe with icon : pyinstaller.exe --onefile --windowed --icon=app.ico app.py (the icon MUST be a .ico file, go to conversio to transform .png/jpg into one)

The code is now full of comments so you shouldn't have any trouble understanding it

Posting this again in case you didn't saw it (kinda useless since that's the .py file but eh better than nothin)
